<h2>More datails</h2>
3 branches were created:
<p>1. master (default)</p>
<p>2. new_branch</p>
<p>3. third_branch</p>

<p>Each branch created its own commits, after which branches 2 and 3 were merged with branch number 1. At the same time, branch 3 was pushed to a remote repository and there I used a pull request, after which branch 3 was merged with branch number 1. After that, branch has been pulled into the local repository.</p>
